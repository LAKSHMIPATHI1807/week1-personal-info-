Project Technical Requirements
•	Use variables to store at least 4 pieces of personal information.
•	Get user input for at least 2 pieces of information.
•	Display all information in a nicely formatted output.
•	Use comments to explain what each part of your code does.
•	Handle basic user input validation.
•	Use string methods to format the output.


Technical Details
- In this section, I will explain how I met the technical requirements.
1. I used four static variables. For these four static variables, we will give input at the time of variable creation only. These are fixed variables.(static)
2. And also, I used two variables for dynamic input. For these, input is given by the user at the time of run-time.(dynamic)
3.To display all the information in a neat manner, to give as an output, I used string methods using f-string.
4.Also, to handle basic user input validation, I used while loop. Which will help me in checking whether the  input is given or not. If not given, while loop will check and show a message to enter the input to the user.
